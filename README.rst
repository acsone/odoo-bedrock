============================
Odoo Bedrock container image
============================

/!\ this is alpha stuff, use at your own risk, expect things to change /!\

This image is meant as a greatest common denominator foundation to run Odoo.

It is a BYOO (bring-your-own-odoo) image, which means you need
to create a derived image which adds your Odoo and addons.
This image does not mandate any particular installation method 
for Odoo and addons, nor does it impose any constraint on your project
structure.

Features
========

* Ubuntu 18.04 minimal, because it's small and has recent pythons
* python, obviously
* `confd <https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd>`_ to generate
  the Odoo configuration file from environment variables or any other source
* `gosu <https://github.com/tianon/gosu>`_ to step down from root in the entrypoint
* ``nano``, ``less``, for some rudimentary comfort when the time comes to investigate
  the container on the terminal
* Odoo external dependencies, depending on the version (wkhtmltopdf, lessc, etc)

Note **Odoo's python dependencies are not included**: you need to pip install
Odoo's requirements.txt. This is not done in the base image as different projects
may require different versions of these libraries.

The entrypoint does the following:

* confd + gosu, mostly. TBC

Configuration
=============

TBC

Required environment variables:

* ``DB_HOST``, ``DB_USER``, ``DB_PASSWORD``, ``DB_NAME``

Examples
========

These are typical Dockerfiles derived from this image, provided here
for inspiration.

Installing addons and Odoo from source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assume you have odoo source code in ``./src/odoo`` and your addons
in ``myaddons``. You can create the following Dockerfile::

  FROM acsone/odoo-bedrock:10.0-latest

  COPY ./src/odoo /odoo/src/odoo
  RUN \
    pip install --no-cache-dir \
      -r /odoo/src/odoo/requirements.txt \
      -f https://wheelhouse.acsone.eu/manylinux1 \
    && pip install -e /odoo/src/odoo

  COPY ./addons /odoo/addons

  ENV ADDONS_PATH=/odoo/src/odoo/addons,/odoo/src/odoo/odoo/addons,/odoo/addons

Note the use of ``-f https://wheelhouse.acsone.eu/manylinux1`` to
find binary wheels that work without additional system dependencies.
This is not mandadatory but helps having an image without build tools.

Installing from pre-built manylinux wheels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your Odoo project is a regular python project with dependencies
(including Odoo itself) declared in a `requirements.txt` you can use
such a Dockerfile::

  FROM acsone/odoo-bedrock:10.0-latest

  RUN pip install --no-index --no-deps /tmp/release/*.whl

This method assumes the wheel files, including Odoo itself,
have been built outside the container before hand using, for example,
`pip wheel -r requirements.txt --wheel-dir=release/`.

Notice there is no COPY statement. That's because you can use
`buildah <https://github.com/containers/buildah>`_ to create an OCI compliant image,
using a bind mounted volume during build::

  buildah bud --volume $PWD/release:/tmp/release -t image:tag .

Credits
=======

Inspiration has been drawn from `camptocamp/odoo-project <https://github.com/camptocamp/docker-odoo-project>`_
in particular many environment variables, the odoo config file templates, entrypoint.sh and the travis config.
This is by design, in other to facilitate possible future convergence.
