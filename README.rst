============================
Odoo Bedrock container image
============================

This image is meant as a greatest common denominator foundation to run Odoo.

It is a BYOO (bring-your-own-odoo) image, which means you need
to create a derived image that adds your Odoo and addons.
This image does not mandate any particular installation method
for Odoo and addons, nor does it impose any constraint on your project
structure.

Features exposed by these images
================================

.. note::
   
   Anything not documented here considered implementation detail and may change.

* Ubuntu minimal because it's small and has recent pythons
  
  * 22.04 for Odoo 16 images
  * 20.04 for Odoo 14 and 15 images
  * 18.04 for Odoo <= 13 images

* ``python``, obviously. 
* An entrypoint that generates the Odoo config file (``$ODOO_RC``) from environment
  variables (see the list of supported variables below).
* ``/usr/local/bin/wkhtmltopdf`` is the `kwkhtmltopdf
  <https://github.com/acsone/kwkhtmltopdf>`_ client. The default
  KWKHTMLTOPDF_SERVER_URL environment variable is set to http://kwkhtmltopdf.
* Odoo mandatory external dependencies (i.e. ``lessc`` for Odoo < 12)
* ``nano``, ``less``, for some rudimentary comfort when the time comes to investigate
  the container on the terminal
* postgres `apt repo <https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt>`_ for easy installation
  of the latest postgres client tools if needed

Note **Odoo's python dependencies are not included**: you need to pip install
Odoo's ``requirements.txt``, or apt install them.
This is not done in the base image as different projects
may require different versions of these libraries.

Other dependencies are also notably absent (graphviz, antiword, poppler-utils),
these being unused in the latest Odoo version and infrequently used in older
versions.

The entrypoint does the following:

* Generate the ``$ODOO_RC`` file from environment variables
* If the command looks like odoo, run scripts in ``/odoo/start-entrypoint.d/``.
* Unless ``$NOGOSU`` is set, run the entry point scripts, as well as the command, under
  user ``$LOCAL_USER_ID`` (defaults to 999).

For more details, read `./bin/entrypoint.sh <./bin/entrypoint.sh>`_.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following environment variables are used to generate the Odoo configuration file in
``$ODOO_RC``:

* ``DB_HOST``
* ``DB_USER``
* ``DB_PASSWORD``
* ``DB_NAME``
* ... TODO

Examples
========

These are typical Dockerfiles derived from this image, provided here
for inspiration.

Installing addons and Odoo from source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assume you have odoo source code in ``./src/odoo`` and your addons
in ``myaddons``. You can create the following Dockerfile:

.. code:: dockerfile

  FROM ghcr.io/acsone/odoo-bedrock:14.0-py38-latest

  COPY ./src/odoo /odoo/src/odoo
  RUN \
    pip install --no-cache-dir \
      -r /odoo/src/odoo/requirements.txt \
      -f https://wheelhouse.acsone.eu/manylinux2014 \
    && pip install -e /odoo/src/odoo

  COPY ./myaddons /odoo/myaddons

  ENV ADDONS_PATH=/odoo/src/odoo/addons,/odoo/src/odoo/odoo/addons,/odoo/myaddons

Note:

- the use of ``-f https://wheelhouse.acsone.eu/manylinux2014`` to
  find binary wheels that work without additional system dependencies.
  This is not mandadatory but helps having an image without build tools.
- for python2.7 Odoo versions (8.0, 9.0 and 10.0) please use
  ``-f https://wheelhouse.acsone.eu/manylinux1``

Credits
=======

Inspiration has been drawn from
`camptocamp/docker-odoo-project <https://github.com/camptocamp/docker-odoo-project>`_
for most environment variables, the odoo config file templates,
and entrypoint.sh.
This is by design, in order to facilitate possible future convergence.
